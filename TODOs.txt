* Implement suit_mapping as a named tuple?!?!?!

*TODO: AM i allowed to open with the called ace?

* Add a force_play to BaseBot for debugging. 

# Otherplayersmayhave should be stored IN the nodes, and updated iteratively, 
	rather than having to run through the whole game history every time!!!

# add in a winners function into the state. Currently I can't debug the winners except for if i print them 

# add a check at the end of the game to see if everyone played by the rules. 

# Need more robust checks on gamesate

# Idea, add winner_points variable to the utility function so that running tallies remain zero sum. 

# Change node creation so that the card_constraints are updated iteratively!. This should save time. 
 

# winning_player in gamestate can be replaced by a dictionary which maps card to priority. Changes O(n) runtime to O(1).

# Distribute_cards takes up 25% of TOTAL RUNTIME. NEED TO MAKE THIS FASTER.

# STATE NEEDS TO CHECK IF THE PLAYERS HAVE PLAYED IN A GOOD ORDER.

# Put in multiprocessing for battle-royale. 


# Add in a special exception that says when someone has misplayed!

# Make it so that humans can reset the game state to a previous round. Current interface chokes up all the time.

# Need a heuristic agent. 

# I CAN make a total ordering on cards, have all 7's =1 , 8's =2 etc... up to H7 ... EO. ! can now define a play_highest_card.

#ROBOT in humanInterface never states his preferences!

# Eliminate equivalent card choices in tree search
