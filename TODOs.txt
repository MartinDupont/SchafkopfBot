* Find out how to properly create a folder structure for the bot package. 

* merge TRUMP_ORDERING and normal _CARD_ORDERINGS with just a single ordering. duh. 

* Figure out how to make a human-operable interface

* Bot vs Humans should be a series of command_line inputs
 * The Human interface should inherit from the Arena, to not repeat myself
* Put in dummy bots whose play_card() function takes a user input.

* I need a bot base class, proxyBot inherits too much crap from DumbBot.

* Probably need an Arena base class too. 

* Separate contsants.py and move functions to utils.py

* make sketch code for a play loop for each mode. 


* DumbBot should literally only play cards or generate sucessors. Only internal parameter is the hand.


* OtherPlayersMayHave obviously also belongs in the state...... or does it??????
* State never knows anyones hands.



* Implement suit_mapping as a named tuple?!?!?!

*TODO: AM i allowed to open with the called ace?

* put a print method in for the state
